## Session Objectives (Session 004)

### Quick Wins (30-60 min each)

#### Option 1: Issue #16 - AthleticNET Logo Inclusion üé®
**Priority**: LOW (nice-to-have)
**Effort**: 30-45 minutes

**Goal**: Add AthleticNET logo next to athlete names that link to Athletic.net

**Current State**:
- Athletes with `anet_athlete_hnd` have text links to Athletic.net
- Links show "View on Athletic.net" title on hover
- No visual indicator (just blue underlined text)

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```jsx
// Current (AthleteTable.jsx line 72-84)
<a href={`https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/Athlete.aspx?AID=${row.anet_athlete_hnd}`}
   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="athlete-name-link">
  {fullName} <span className="external-link-icon">‚Üó</span>
</a>

// Enhanced
<a href={`https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/Athlete.aspx?AID=${row.anet_athlete_hnd}`}
   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="athlete-name-link">
  {fullName}
  <img src="/path/to/athletic-net-logo.svg" alt="Athletic.net" className="anet-logo" />
</a>
```

**Implementation**:
1. Download/create AthleticNET logo SVG (small, ~16x16px)
2. Add logo to `frontend/public/` directory
3. Update AthleteTable.jsx to use logo instead of ‚Üó
4. Style logo with CSS (margin-left: 4px, opacity: 0.7, hover: 1.0)

**Files to Update**:
- `frontend/public/athletic-net-logo.svg` (new file)
- `frontend/src/components/AthleteTable.jsx`
- `frontend/src/App.css` (style .anet-logo)

---

#### Option 2: Issue #15 - Season Resume Integration in Team Page üèÜ
**Priority**: MEDIUM (useful feature)
**Effort**: 1-2 hours

**Goal**: Integrate season resume data into team profile page

**Current State**:
- Team profile shows basic info (rank, score, region, conference)
- Displays roster with athlete rankings
- No performance history or resume data

**Database Tables Available**:
```sql
iz_groups_season_resumes
- group_resume_id (PK)
- season_year
- anet_group_hnd (team ID)
- division_code
- gender_code
- resume_html (HTML content)
- created_at, updated_at
```

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```jsx
// TeamProfile.jsx - add new section
<div className="season-resume-section">
  <h3>Season Resume</h3>
  {resumeData ? (
    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: resumeData.resume_html }} />
  ) : (
    <p>No season resume available for this team</p>
  )}
</div>
```

**Implementation**:
1. **Backend** (API endpoint):
   - Create `/teams/{team_id}/resume` endpoint
   - Query `iz_groups_season_resumes` table
   - Return HTML content and metadata

2. **Frontend** (TeamProfile component):
   - Fetch resume data on team profile load
   - Render HTML safely with dangerouslySetInnerHTML
   - Style resume container to match USTFCCCA branding
   - Add loading/error states

**Files to Update**:
- `api/routes/teams.py` (new endpoint)
- `api/services/team_service.py` (resume fetch logic)
- `frontend/src/components/TeamProfile.jsx`
- `frontend/src/App.css` (resume styling)

**Testing**:
- Verify resume loads for teams with data
- Handle teams without resume gracefully
- Check HTML rendering (sanitization not needed - trusted source)

---

### Infrastructure Tasks (Optional, Low Priority)

#### Option 3: Issue #6 - Systemd Service Fix üîß
**Priority**: LOW (manual startup works fine)
**Effort**: 1-2 hours

**Goal**: Get systemd user service working for API

**Current State**:
- Manual uvicorn startup: Works perfectly
- Systemd service: Configured but not used
- Deployment: Uses manual nohup command

**Why It's Low Priority**:
- Current manual startup is reliable
- No production issues
- Easy to restart if needed
- Not worth debugging systemd quirks

**If You Want to Tackle It**:
1. Review `deployment/xcri-api.service`
2. Check systemd user service logs
3. Verify WorkingDirectory and ExecStart paths
4. Test `systemctl --user start xcri-api`
5. Debug any environment variable issues

**Or**: Skip this entirely - manual startup works great!

---

#### Option 4: Issue #10 - Shared Header/Footer üèóÔ∏è
**Priority**: LOW (architectural change)
**Effort**: 3-4 hours

**Goal**: Use shared USTFCCCA header/footer from parent iz-apps-clean repo

**Current State**:
- XCRI has custom Header.jsx and Footer.jsx components
- Parent repo has shared components in `shared/templates/`
- Would require significant refactoring

**Challenges**:
- Flask templates vs React components (incompatible)
- Would need to convert shared header to React
- Or serve XCRI as Flask app (major rewrite)

**Recommendation**: **SKIP THIS** - Current setup works perfectly
- XCRI header matches USTFCCCA branding
- Navigation is appropriate
- Not worth the refactoring effort

---

## Remaining Open Issues Overview

**Total**: 6 open issues (11 closed, 65% completion rate)

**Quick Wins** (30-60 min):
- Issue #16: AthleticNET logo inclusion

**Medium Effort** (1-2 hours):

**Low Priority / Skip**:
- Issue #6: Systemd service (manual works fine)

## Known Issues / Notes

### AthleticNET Logo (Issue #16)

**Design Considerations**:
- Logo should be subtle (not distract from athlete name)
- Small size: 14-16px height
- Position: After athlete name, before external link icon
- Opacity: 0.6 normal, 1.0 on hover
- Alt text: "View on Athletic.net"

**Where to Find Logo**:
- Option 1: Download from Athletic.net press kit
- Option 2: Create simple SVG icon
- Option 3: Use favicon from https://www.athletic.net/

### Season Resume (Issue #15)

**HTML Sanitization**:
- resume_html comes from trusted USTFCCCA database
- No user-generated content
- Safe to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- Still wrap in container for styling

**Styling Challenges**:
- Resume HTML may have inline styles
- Need to scope CSS to not conflict with app
- Add .season-resume-container wrapper
- Override font sizes to match app typography

---

## Testing Checklist

### Issue #16 (AthleticNET Logo)
- [ ] Logo displays next to athlete names with anet_athlete_hnd
- [ ] Logo has proper alt text
- [ ] Logo doesn't display for athletes without handle
- [ ] Hover state works (increased opacity)
- [ ] Mobile: Logo is visible and appropriately sized
- [ ] Link still works correctly

### Issue #15 (Season Resume)
- [ ] API endpoint returns resume HTML
- [ ] Frontend fetches and renders resume
- [ ] Loading state shows while fetching
- [ ] Error state handles missing resume gracefully
- [ ] HTML renders correctly (no XSS issues)
- [ ] Styling matches USTFCCCA branding

---

## Example URLs for Testing

**Base URL**: https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/

**Athlete with Athletic.net link** (for Issue #16):
- Mary Ogwoka: anet_athlete_hnd = 29547182
- Any top-ranked athlete should have handle

**Team with season resume** (for Issue #15):
- Need to check database for teams with resume data
- Query: `SELECT DISTINCT anet_group_hnd FROM iz_groups_season_resumes WHERE season_year = 2025 LIMIT 10;`

---

## Performance Considerations

**Issue #16 (Logo)**:
- Use SVG for scalability
- Optimize file size (< 2KB)
- Consider sprite sheet if multiple icons

**Issue #15 (Resume)**:
- Cache resume data client-side
- Don't fetch on every team profile load
- Consider pagination if resume is very long
- Loading state to prevent janky render
