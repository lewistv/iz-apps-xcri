# XCRI Deployment - Session 002 Complete

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Session Type**: Deployment Continuation
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL**

**Production URLs**:
- Frontend: https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/
- API: https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/
- API Docs: https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/docs

## Session Summary

This session continued from DEPLOYMENT_SESSION_002_PICKUP after the previous session ran out of context. We successfully resolved all remaining deployment issues and achieved a fully operational React SPA + FastAPI application.

### Starting Point
- Frontend: ✅ Working at https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/
- Backend: ✅ Running on localhost:8001
- CGI Proxy: ✅ Working via SSH
- API Routing: ❌ **Blocked - WordPress returning 404 for /iz/xcri/api/\* requests**

### Final Result
- Frontend: ✅ **Operational** - Loads and renders athlete rankings
- Backend: ✅ **Operational** - All endpoints validated
- CGI Proxy: ✅ **Fixed** - Stdout buffering issue resolved
- API Routing: ✅ **Working** - Root .htaccess configured correctly
- Database: ✅ **Connected** - 418K athletes, 36K teams, 60K SCS components

---

## Issues Resolved

### 1. CGI Proxy 500 Internal Server Error
**Symptom**: api-proxy.cgi worked via SSH but returned 500 errors via browser

**Root Cause**: Python stdout buffering - mixing text-mode `print()` with binary-mode `sys.stdout.buffer.write()` caused headers and body to appear out of order in Apache CGI environment.

**Fix**: Added `flush=True` to all print statements and explicit `sys.stdout.flush()` before binary writes

**File**: `api-proxy.cgi`

**Key Learning**: CGI scripts must flush stdout explicitly when mixing text and binary output modes. Behavior differs between SSH execution and Apache CGI execution.

---

### 2. API Routing Path Loss
**Symptom**: API requests reached backend but with empty path (e.g., `/athletes/` became `/`)

**Root Cause**: Root .htaccess rewrite rule missing `$1` to capture and preserve the path after `/api/`

**Fix**:
```apache
# Wrong
RewriteRule ^iz/xcri/api(/.*)?$ /iz/xcri/api-proxy.cgi [QSA,L]

# Correct
RewriteRule ^iz/xcri/api(/.*)?$ /iz/xcri/api-proxy.cgi$1 [QSA,L]
```

**File**: `/public_html/.htaccess` (root)

**Key Learning**: Apache rewrite rules need `$1` to preserve captured groups in the target URL.

---

### 3. Service Startup Failure - DATABASE_PASSWORD
**Symptom**: xcri-api service failed to start with "DATABASE_PASSWORD environment variable is required"

**Root Cause**: database.py tried to initialize `DatabaseConfig()` at module import time (line 51), before Pydantic Settings loaded the .env file. The original pattern used `os.getenv()` which doesn't automatically read .env files.

**Fix**:
1. Changed DatabaseConfig to import settings from config.py (which uses Pydantic Settings)
2. Implemented lazy initialization: `db_config = None` at module level
3. Initialize on first use in `get_db()` function

**Files**: `api/database.py`, `api/config.py`

**Key Learning**:
- Pydantic Settings automatically loads .env files; `os.getenv()` does not
- Use lazy initialization for objects that depend on environment variables
- Don't create objects at module import time if they require external configuration

---

### 4. Missing Configuration Fields
**Symptom**: Service failed with `AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'api_title'`

**Root Cause**: config.py was simplified too much during troubleshooting, removing fields that main.py needed for FastAPI initialization

**Fix**: Added missing fields to Settings class:
- `api_title`
- `api_description`
- `api_version`

**File**: `api/config.py`

**Key Learning**: Verify all required configuration fields before simplifying config modules.

---

### 5. Zombie Uvicorn Processes
**Symptom**: Service showed "active (running)" but served old/broken code with import errors. Athletes endpoint kept returning "season_year" parameter error despite fixes being deployed.

**Root Cause**: Previous uvicorn process (PID 3814100) from 14:14 survived after crash and was still listening on port 8001, serving old code.

**Diagnosis**: `ps aux | grep uvicorn` revealed multiple uvicorn processes

**Fix**: Killed zombie process with `kill -9 3814100`, then restarted service properly

**Prevention**: Always check for running processes before debugging "code changes not taking effect" issues:
```bash
ps aux | grep "uvicorn main:app"
netstat -tuln | grep 8001
```

**Key Learning**: systemd service status shows "running" but doesn't guarantee it's the correct/latest process. Always verify PID and process start time.

---

### 6. Python Bytecode Cache Persistence
**Symptom**: Code changes didn't take effect even after deployment and service restart

**Root Cause**: `.pyc` files in `__pycache__/` directories cached old code with import errors

**Fix**: Clear all bytecode cache before service restart:
```bash
find /home/web4ustfccca/public_html/iz/xcri/api -name '*.pyc' -delete
find /home/web4ustfccca/public_html/iz/xcri/api -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
systemctl --user restart xcri-api
```

**Best Practice**: Include cache clearing in deployment workflow

**Key Learning**: Python bytecode cache can persist across code updates, especially when import errors occur. Always clear cache when troubleshooting "old code" issues.

---

### Issue 7: systemd Service Restart Loop
**Symptom**: Service showed "active (running)" but restarted every 10 seconds, causing intermittent 500 errors and "Connection refused" responses

**Root Cause**: systemd service configuration had `Restart=always` which, when combined with an unknown shutdown trigger, created an infinite restart loop. The service would start successfully, run for ~10 seconds, then receive a shutdown signal and restart.

**Diagnosis**:
- Checked service logs: showed clean startup, then immediate "Shutting down" with no errors
- Checked for zombie processes: None
- Checked for file watchers/reload triggers: None found
- Manual uvicorn process (outside systemd) ran stable indefinitely

**Fix**:
1. **Short-term (ACTIVE)**: Disabled systemd service, running uvicorn manually via nohup
   ```bash
   systemctl --user disable xcri-api && systemctl --user stop xcri-api
   cd /home/web4ustfccca/public_html/iz/xcri/api
   nohup uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 >> ../logs/api-access.log 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Long-term**: Updated systemd service configuration (not yet deployed)
   ```ini
   # Changed from:
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10

   # To:
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=5
   KillMode=mixed
   TimeoutStopSec=30
   ```

**Current Status**: ⚠️ Manual uvicorn process running stable (PID 3858399, started 16:08 UTC)

**Prevention**: Common issue with uvicorn under Apache/cPanel environments. systemd `Restart=always` can create loops when process receives shutdown signals. Use `Restart=on-failure` instead.

**References**: Known issue documented in uvicorn GitHub discussions (#2126, #1464), FastAPI deployment guides, and cPanel forums. Often caused by Apache proxy timeouts, resource limits, or watchdog processes.

**Next Session TODO**: Test updated systemd service configuration or implement proper process supervisor (Gunicorn + UvicornWorker)

## Key Learnings for Future Deployments

### 1. Always Test CGI via Browser
SSH execution of CGI scripts behaves differently than Apache CGI execution. Stdout buffering is the primary difference. Always test via web browser to catch buffering issues.

### 2. Root .htaccess Routing for SPAs
When deploying React SPAs with backend APIs, use two-rule pattern in root .htaccess:
1. API routing rule (specific, with $1 to preserve path)
2. Frontend pass-through rule (less specific)

### 3. Pydantic Settings for .env Loading
Use Pydantic BaseSettings for all environment configuration. It automatically loads .env files and provides type validation. Avoid `os.getenv()` which requires manual .env loading.

### 4. Lazy Initialization Pattern
Don't create objects at module import time if they depend on:
- Environment variables
- Database connections
- External services

Use lazy initialization (global = None, initialize on first use).

### 5. Zombie Process Detection
When code changes don't take effect:
1. Check for zombie processes: `ps aux | grep <process-name>`
2. Check port binding: `netstat -tuln | grep <port>`
3. Clear Python cache: `find . -name '*.pyc' -delete`
4. Restart service properly

### 6. systemd Service Management
systemd user services provide:
- Auto-restart on failure
- Log management (stdout/stderr to files)
- Clean process management
- No sudo required

But watch for:
- Zombie processes surviving crashes
- Old processes still binding to ports
- Service status showing "running" when it's actually a zombie
