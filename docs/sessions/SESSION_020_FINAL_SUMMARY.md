## What Was Completed

### ‚úÖ Feature Integration (Session 031 Database Fields)

**Backend Changes**:
- Added 3 fields to TeamKnockoutRanking: `regl_group_name`, `conf_group_name`, `most_recent_race_date`
- Added 3 fields to TeamKnockoutMatchup: `meet_id`, `team_a_ko_rank`, `team_b_ko_rank`
- Updated SQL queries in `team_knockout_service.py`
- Fixed critical Python format string escaping bug: `%%Y` instead of `%Y` for aiomysql

**Frontend Changes**:
- Enabled server-side region/conference filtering in App.jsx
- Fixed Athletic.net meet links to use `meet_id` field in MatchupHistoryModal.jsx
- Added opponent knockout rank badges in matchup history
- Updated CSS for ko-rank-badge styling

**Files Modified**: 6 files (models.py, team_knockout_service.py, App.jsx, MatchupHistoryModal.jsx, MatchupHistoryModal.css, CLAUDE.md)

## Critical Incidents and Resolutions

### üö® Catastrophic Failure: Git Operations Deleted All IZ Applications

**What Happened**: Git clean operation deleted all application files from `/iz` directory on production server

**Impact**: Complete outage of all 5 IZ applications:
- Root /iz landing page
- XC Scoreboard
- Season Resume
- XCRI Frontend
- XCRI API

**Root Cause**: Production server is NOT a git repository, deployed via rsync. Git operations should NEVER be run on production.

**Resolution**: Emergency restoration via rsync from local repository
- Restored: xc-scoreboard/, season-resume/, shared/, root /iz files, XCRI frontend, XCRI API
- Fixed: Database configuration (.env files, localhost host, correct password)
- Cleared: Python bytecode cache
- Duration: ~45 minutes to full restoration

**User Feedback**: "I'm guessing all of this has to do with the 'shared' folder /iz/shared was probably also deleted" - User correctly identified missing shared directory

---

### üî¥ Security Issues Discovered

**Issue 1: XCRI API .env Permissions**
- Problem: File had 644 permissions (world-readable) instead of 600
- Impact: Database password potentially readable by other users on shared server
- Fix: `chmod 600` applied
- Duration: 1 minute

**Issue 2: Python Source Files Publicly Accessible**
- Problem: `/iz/shared/database.py` returned HTTP 200 with full source code
- Root Cause: Root /iz .htaccess only blocked .md and .env files
- Impact: Application source code visible to public
- Fix: Updated .htaccess to block .py, .pyc, .pyo, .log, .ini, .cnf, .json, .yaml, .yml
- Duration: 3 minutes

**Security Sweep Duration**: 4 minutes from discovery to resolution

## Documentation Created

### 1. CLAUDE.md Updates (334 insertions)

**New Section**: "üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES AND COMMON PITFALLS"

**6 Critical Rules Documented**:
1. Never Use Git Operations on Production Server
2. Database Configuration Patterns (.env location, localhost host)
3. Python Format String Escaping in SQL (`%%Y` for aiomysql)
4. API Process Restart After Code Changes
5. Flask /iz/shared/ Directory (critical for all Flask apps)
6. Deployment Verification Checklist (all 5 applications)

**Additional Content**:
- Common Deployment Errors and Solutions (4 error types with fixes)
- Emergency Recovery Procedures (11-step restoration guide)
- Safe Deployment Practices (DO/DON'T lists)

### 2. Subagent Specifications (640 lines)

**File**: `docs/SUBAGENT_SPECIFICATIONS.md`

**3 Agents Specified**:
1. **XCRI API Restart Agent** (Priority 1) - 15-step procedure
2. **XCRI Frontend Deploy Agent** (Priority 3) - 13-step procedure
3. **IZ Applications Verification Agent** (Priority 2) - 13+ test procedure

**Each Specification Includes**:
- Purpose and responsibility (SRP)
- Input parameters and output format
- Step-by-step bash commands
- Error handling and safety checks
- Success criteria and related documentation

**Status**: Specifications only, not yet implemented
**Decision**: Try documentation-first approach, implement only if needed

### 3. Security Sweep Report (264 lines)

**File**: `docs/SECURITY_SWEEP_SESSION_020.md`

**Contents**:
- Executive summary
- 2 critical issues with detailed analysis
- Security verification results (all tests)
- Timeline (4-minute resolution)
- Lessons learned and recommendations

### 4. Session History Updates

**Updated Sections in CLAUDE.md**:
- Current Status: Session 020 completion noted
- Session History: Comprehensive Session 020 entry added
- Next Session: Outlined Session 021 testing plan
- Last Updated: Changed to October 29, 2025

## Technical Achievements

### Backend Bug Fixes

**Critical Fix**: Python format string escaping in SQL
```python
# WRONG - Causes ValueError
DATE_FORMAT(field, '%Y-%m-%d')

# CORRECT - aiomysql requires double %%
DATE_FORMAT(field, '%%Y-%%m-%%d')
```

**Why This Matters**: aiomysql uses Python's `%` operator for parameter binding. Single `%` is interpreted as format specifier before reaching MySQL.

**Files Affected**: `api/services/team_knockout_service.py` (lines 106-107, 186-187)

### Deployment Improvements

**Process Standardization**:
- Clear bytecode cache before restart
- Always verify 5 processes running (1 parent + 4 workers)
- Test health endpoint before declaring success
- Verify all 5 IZ applications after any deployment

**Security Hardening**:
- All .env files: 600 permissions
- All Python files: Blocked from web access
- All sensitive file types: Comprehensive .htaccess rules

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **Git operations on production**: Caused complete system outage
2. **Insufficient security checks**: Python files were publicly accessible
3. **File permissions oversight**: .env file had wrong permissions after rsync
4. **Lack of automated validation**: No pre-deployment security checks

### What Went Right

1. **User collaboration**: User identified missing shared directory quickly
2. **Comprehensive backups**: Local repository enabled full restoration
3. **Quick response**: Security issues fixed within 4 minutes
4. **No data loss**: All applications fully restored and operational
5. **Documentation**: Extensive documentation prevents future issues

### Key Insights

1. **Production server is NOT a git repository** - This must be remembered always
2. **Emergency restorrations require security validation** - File permissions can change
3. **Documentation is critical** - Comprehensive guides prevent repeated mistakes
4. **User feedback is invaluable** - User spotted missing shared directory
5. **Security sweeps are essential** - Proactive checks catch issues before exploitation
