## User Feedback Collection

**If Session 007 begins**, start by collecting user feedback:

1. **Check Google Analytics** (if data available):
   - Traffic patterns since launch
   - Most popular divisions/genders
   - Filter usage statistics
   - Search behavior
   - User flow and dropoff points

2. **Review Monitoring Data**:
   - API performance trends
   - Error logs (if any)
   - Database query performance
   - Peak usage times

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Coach feedback on rankings display
   - Feature requests
   - Bug reports (if any)
   - Usability issues

4. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Response time trends
   - Database load patterns
   - Slow endpoints
   - Caching effectiveness

---

## Session 007 Suggested Approach

**Phase 1: Assessment** (if session begins)

1. **Review Analytics**:
   ```bash
   # Check if monitoring data is available
   ssh ustfccca-web4 'tail -100 /home/web4ustfccca/public_html/iz/xcri/logs/api-access.log'

   # Review Google Analytics dashboard
   # (User would provide GA insights)
   ```

2. **Check Production Health**:
   ```bash
   # API health check
   curl https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/health | jq

   # Performance test
   time curl -s "https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/athletes/?division=2030&gender=M&limit=10"

   # Process status
   ssh ustfccca-web4 'ps aux | grep "uvicorn main:app"'
   ```

3. **User Feedback Review**:
   - Ask user if any feedback has been received
   - Review GitHub issues (if new ones created)
   - Check for feature requests
   - Identify pain points

**Phase 2: Prioritization** (if enhancements requested)

Based on user feedback, prioritize enhancements by:
1. **Impact**: How many users benefit?
2. **Effort**: How complex is implementation?
3. **Value**: Does it solve a real problem?
4. **Alignment**: Does it support core mission?

**Phase 3: Implementation** (if enhancements selected)

Follow standard development workflow:
1. Update documentation with enhancement goals
2. Implement changes (frontend/backend)
3. Test locally
4. Deploy to production
5. Verify in production
6. Update session documentation
