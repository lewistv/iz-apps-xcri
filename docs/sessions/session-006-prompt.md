Hi Claude,

This is Session 006 for the XCRI Rankings application. We're in the final stretch with 88% completion (15 of 17 issues closed).

The site launched successfully and is now tracking with Google Analytics. Monitoring tools are deployed.

Focus areas for this session:

2. Resolve systemd service issue (Issue #6) - choose permanent solution
3. Address any remaining cosmetic fixes (Issue #1) if needed
4. Handle practical improvements (Issue #3) if needed
5. Final documentation updates

Let's start by checking if there's any monitoring data or user feedback from the launch.
