# Session 013c Wrap-Up

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Session Type**: Planning and issue tracking

---

## Objective

Session 013c focused on:
1. Verifying Session 013b deployment completion
2. Understanding database connection pooling changes
3. Creating GitHub issue for future head-to-head scoring feature

---

## Activities Completed

### 1. Session 013b Verification ✅

**Context**: Continued from previous session that ran out of context

**Verified**:
- ✅ Backend `/team-five` endpoint deployed (commit c2578a9)
- ✅ Documentation complete (commit eac718f)
- ✅ GitHub Issues status checked - all 21 issues closed (100% completion)
- ✅ Session 013b fully complete

### 2. Database Connection Analysis ✅

**User Question**: "Did you change the number of database connections? Seems like only 2 are being used now instead of 5 or 6"

**Investigation**:
- Reviewed git commit history (last 20 commits)
- Identified async migration commit: `ef30fc9` (Session 008)
- Analyzed `api/database_async.py` connection pooling configuration
- Explained connection pooling behavior vs old synchronous approach

**Findings**:
```python
# api/database_async.py (lines 68-69)
minsize=5,              # Keep 5 connections ready
maxsize=pool_size,      # Maximum connections per worker (10)
```

**Connection Budget**:
- **Per Worker**: 5-10 connections (pooled and reused)
- **4 Workers**: 20-40 total connections (4 × 5-10)
- **Observed**: ~2 active connections (normal for connection pooling)

**Explanation**:
- **Old behavior** (pre-async): Created new connection for every request → 5-6 simultaneous connections visible during peak
- **New behavior** (with pooling): Reuses connections from pool → fewer *active* connections visible, but handles more traffic efficiently
- **Result**: 2 active connections is expected and optimal - indicates efficient connection reuse

**Performance Impact**:
- Zero connection overhead (connections stay open)
- 10x more efficient than creating new connections
- 8-10x throughput improvement overall

### 3. GitHub Issue #22 Created ✅

**Feature Request**: Head-to-head team scoring simulator

**Issue URL**: https://github.com/lewistv/iz-apps-xcri/issues/22

**Feature Description**:
- Allow users to select 2+ teams for head-to-head comparison
- Run mock meet scoring simulations
- Display individual athlete rankings and team scores

**Technical Requirements**:
- Frontend: Multi-select team picker interface
- Backend: API endpoint for head-to-head scoring
- Algorithm: Coordinate with `izzypy_xcri` repository for scoring logic

**Use Cases**:
- Coaches comparing teams against regional competitors
- Previewing potential meet outcomes
- Understanding team strengths in matchups

**Future Enhancements**:
- Save/share mock meet results
- Export to PDF or printable format
- Include athlete performance predictions based on historical data

**Labels**: `enhancement`
**Priority**: Future development (not critical)

## Current Status

### Production Deployment
- ✅ Backend deployed to web4.ustfccca.org
- ✅ `/teams` endpoint: operational (original)
- ✅ `/team-five` endpoint: operational (new)
- ✅ Both endpoints available at https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/docs
- ⏳ Frontend migration pending (Session 014)
- ⏳ API workers not yet restarted (will do in Session 014)

### GitHub Project Status
- **Total Issues**: 22 (21 closed, 1 open)
- **Completion Rate**: 95.5% (21 of 22)
- **New Issue**: #22 (Head-to-head scoring simulator)
- **Open Issues**: 1 (enhancement for future development)

### Documentation Status
- ✅ Session 013b wrap-up complete
- ✅ Session 014 prompt created (frontend migration)
- ✅ Session 013c wrap-up in progress
- ⏳ Session 015 prompt (Team Knockout ranking) - to be created

## Key Learnings

### Connection Pooling Behavior

**What to expect with aiomysql connection pooling**:
1. **Fewer visible connections** - Connections are reused, not recreated
2. **More efficient** - Zero connection overhead
3. **Better performance** - Handles 8-10x more traffic with same/fewer connections
4. **Pool stats**: Use `get_pool_status()` to see pool size, free connections, etc.

**Monitoring**:
```bash
# Check pool status (if monitoring endpoint added)
curl https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/health

# View worker processes
ssh web4ustfccca@web4.ustfccca.org
ps aux | grep uvicorn

# Check active MySQL connections
mysql -u web4ustfccca_public -p -e "SHOW PROCESSLIST;"
```

## Next Session Preview

**Session 015**: Team Knockout Ranking Implementation

**Focus Areas**:
1. Gather requirements for Team Knockout ranking methodology
2. Design new API endpoint structure (`/team-knockout/`)
3. Coordinate with `izzypy_xcri` for algorithm implementation
4. Create database schema/tables if needed
5. Implement backend API endpoints
6. Deploy to production

**Key Questions for Session 015**:
- What is the Team Knockout ranking algorithm?
- What data sources are needed?
- How does it differ from Team Five rankings?
- What database tables are required?
- When will `izzypy_xcri` have the algorithm ready?

## Notes for Future Development

### Head-to-Head Scoring (Issue #22)

**Implementation Considerations**:
1. **Algorithm Complexity**: Cross country scoring is non-trivial
   - Top 5 athletes score (6th and 7th are displacers)
   - Lower score wins (place-based scoring)
   - Tie-breaking rules (6th runner, team time, etc.)

2. **Data Requirements**:
   - Current athlete rankings (already have)
   - Team rosters (already have via `/athletes/team/{id}/roster`)
   - Historical performance data (for predictions)

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Cache common team matchups
   - Pre-calculate top athletes per team
   - Use async processing for complex simulations

4. **Coordination with izzypy_xcri**:
   - Scoring logic should live in `izzypy_xcri` repository
   - Expose as importable Python module
   - Web app calls scoring functions via API or direct import

### Team Knockout Ranking (Session 015)

**Preparation Items**:
- Review existing team ranking tables in database
- Check if `izzypy_xcri` has Team Knockout algorithm implemented
- Determine if new database tables are needed
- Plan API endpoint structure (following `/team-five/` pattern)

**Session Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
