## Work Completed

### 1. Athletic.net Branding (Issue #16)

**Changes**:
- Added Athletic.net logo and attribution to breadcrumb (right-aligned)
- Created responsive design for logo and "Data provided by" text
- Maintained flexbox layout for proper spacing

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/Breadcrumb.jsx` - Added attribution section
- `frontend/src/components/Breadcrumb.css` - Styled attribution with responsive breakpoints

**Result**: Athletic.net branding now appears on every page with proper attribution

---

### 2. Season Resume Integration (Issue #15)

**Backend Changes**:
- Modified `/teams/{id}` endpoint to include season resume data
- Added LEFT JOIN to `iz_groups_season_resumes` table
- Mapped `team_fk` to `division_group_id` for proper data retrieval
- Return `season_resume_html` field when available

**Frontend Changes**:
- Updated `TeamTable.jsx` to display season resume links
- Added "View Season Resume" button for teams with resume data
- Created modal to display season resume HTML content
- Styled modal with proper scrolling and close functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `api/routes/teams.py` - Added season resume JOIN
- `api/services/team_service.py` - Updated query with resume mapping
- `frontend/src/components/TeamTable.jsx` - Added resume modal and button

**Result**: Teams now have clickable "View Season Resume" links that display their season summary in a modal

---

### 3. Shared Header Integration (Issue #10)

**Investigation**:
- Examined shared header in `iz-apps-clean/shared/templates/base.html`
- Determined conversion from Flask/Jinja2 to React would be straightforward
- No backend dependencies - purely presentational component

**Implementation**:
- Converted Flask/Jinja2 template to React JSX
- Created `Header.jsx` component with WordPress-style structure
- Replicated exact layout: logo, site title/tagline, social links, HOME, MEMBER LOGIN
- Added proper WordPress CSS classes (.wp-block-template-part, .is-layout-flex, etc.)

**Challenges Resolved**:
1. **Deployment broke site (404 errors)**
   - Root cause: `rsync --delete` removed `.htaccess` and `api-proxy.cgi`
   - Fix: Updated deployment script to exclude these files
   - Added auto-restoration if files are missing

2. **Logo not displaying**
   - Root cause 1: Wrong path (`/ustfccca-main-blue.png` instead of `/iz/shared/static/images/`)
   - Root cause 2: File permissions were 600 instead of 644
   - Fix 1: Updated logo src to use shared assets path
   - Fix 2: Added automatic permission fixes to deployment script

3. **Layout spacing issues**
   - Root cause: Missing WordPress layout utility classes
   - Fix: Added proper flexbox gap and layout classes to Header.css

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/Header.jsx` - New shared header component
- `frontend/src/components/Header.css` - WordPress-style CSS
- `deployment/deploy-frontend.sh` - Hardened deployment process

**Result**: XCRI now has the exact same header as other IZ applications, maintaining consistent branding

---

### 4. Page Title Addition

**Implementation**:
- Added "🏆 XCRI: Cross Country Rating Index" title below breadcrumb
- Matches XC Scoreboard design pattern with trophy icon
- Navy blue styling with 3px bottom border
- Responsive typography for mobile devices

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added page-title-section div
- `frontend/src/App.css` - Styled page title with navy blue theming

**Result**: Clear, prominent page title that matches the design language of other IZ applications

---

### 5. Breadcrumb Update

**Implementation**:
- Changed from "Home › Rankings › XCRI" to "USTFCCCA InfoZone › XCRI"
- Made "USTFCCCA InfoZone" a clickable link to https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/
- Simplified hierarchy from 3 levels to 2 levels
- Maintained Athletic.net attribution on right side

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/Breadcrumb.jsx` - Updated breadcrumb structure

**Result**: Breadcrumb now properly represents navigation hierarchy within the InfoZone

---

## Deployment Hardening

### Issues Fixed

1. **rsync --delete removing critical files**
   - Added `--exclude='.htaccess'` and `--exclude='api-proxy.cgi'`
   - Added exclusions for `api/` and `logs/` directories

2. **Missing file restoration**
   - Auto-restore .htaccess if missing from repo
   - Auto-restore api-proxy.cgi if missing and set executable permissions

3. **File permissions for static assets**
   - Automatically chmod 644 for all static assets (png, jpg, css, js, etc.)
   - Automatically chmod 755 for assets directory
   - Prevents 403 Forbidden errors from Apache

### deployment/deploy-frontend.sh Updates

```bash
# Exclude critical files from rsync --delete
rsync -avz --delete \
  --exclude='.htaccess' \
  --exclude='api-proxy.cgi' \
  --exclude='api/' \
  --exclude='logs/' \
  "$DIST_DIR/" "$SERVER:$REMOTE_PATH/"

# Auto-restore .htaccess if missing
if ! ssh "$SERVER" "test -f $REMOTE_PATH/.htaccess"; then
  scp "$PROJECT_ROOT/.htaccess" "$SERVER:$REMOTE_PATH/"
fi

# Auto-restore api-proxy.cgi if missing
if ! ssh "$SERVER" "test -f $REMOTE_PATH/api-proxy.cgi"; then
  scp "$PROJECT_ROOT/api-proxy.cgi" "$SERVER:$REMOTE_PATH/"
  ssh "$SERVER" "chmod +x $REMOTE_PATH/api-proxy.cgi"
fi

# Fix file permissions
ssh "$SERVER" "chmod -R 644 $REMOTE_PATH/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,svg,ico,css,js,html,json} 2>/dev/null || true"
ssh "$SERVER" "chmod 755 $REMOTE_PATH/assets 2>/dev/null || true"
```

**Result**: Deployment is now robust and prevents accidental deletion of critical Apache configuration files

## Technical Details

### WordPress-Style CSS Classes

```css
.wp-block-template-part      /* Header container */
.wp-block-group               /* Content grouping */
.is-layout-flex               /* Flexbox layout with gaps */
.is-layout-constrained        /* Max-width with auto margins */
.is-vertical                  /* Vertical flexbox */
.alignwide                    /* Wide alignment */
.alignfull                    /* Full width */
```

### Season Resume Database Mapping

```sql
-- team_fk in iz_groups_season_resumes maps to division_group_id
LEFT JOIN iz_groups_season_resumes sr
  ON t.division_group_id = sr.team_fk
```

### Shared Asset Paths

```
Shared assets location: /iz/shared/static/images/
Logo path: /iz/shared/static/images/ustfccca-main-blue.png
```
