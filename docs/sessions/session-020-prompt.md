# Session 020 Prompt: Additional Refinements and izzypy_xcri Integration

**Date**: TBD (After izzypy_xcri data structure improvements)
**Session Type**: Integration and Refinements
**Previous Session**: Session 019 - Frontend/Backend Bug Fixes and Refinements

---

## Context

Session 019 successfully addressed 11 of 13 user-reported issues for the Team Knockout feature. However, 2 critical issues were identified that require data structure improvements in the `izzypy_xcri` repository:

1. **Region/Conference Names**: Not populating due to table structure mismatch
2. **Athletic.net Links**: Using race_id twice instead of separate meet_id/race_id

A comprehensive requirements document was created: `docs/sessions/session-019-izzypy-improvements-needed.md`

This session will integrate the izzypy_xcri improvements once available and implement any additional refinements discovered during user testing.

---

## Prerequisites

**Before starting this session**, verify the following from the izzypy_xcri team:

### Required Data Structure Changes

1. **iz_rankings_xcri_team_knockout table** should now include:
   - `regl_group_name` (VARCHAR) - Region name
   - `conf_group_name` (VARCHAR) - Conference name
   - `most_recent_race_date` (DATE) - Team's latest race date

2. **iz_rankings_xcri_team_knockout_matchups table** should now include:
   - `meet_id` (INT) - AthleticNET meet identifier (separate from race_id)

3. **Data has been regenerated** with the new schema for current season (2025)

### Verification Steps

```bash
# Check if new fields exist in database
mysql -e "DESCRIBE iz_rankings_xcri_team_knockout" | grep -E "regl_group_name|conf_group_name|most_recent_race_date"

# Check if meet_id field exists
mysql -e "DESCRIBE iz_rankings_xcri_team_knockout_matchups" | grep "meet_id"

# Verify data is populated
mysql -e "SELECT team_name, regl_group_name, conf_group_name, most_recent_race_date FROM iz_rankings_xcri_team_knockout LIMIT 5"
```

## Session Objectives

### Phase 1: Verify izzypy_xcri Improvements (If Available)

If izzypy_xcri has implemented the data structure changes:

1. **Test Region/Conference Data Population**
   - Check if API responses now include region/conference names
   - Verify data is correct for sample teams
   - Test across different divisions

2. **Update Backend Queries** (if needed)
   - Remove JOIN logic if fields are now direct columns
   - Simplify queries for better performance
   - Update comments to reflect new schema

3. **Test Region/Conference Filters**
   - Verify dropdown menus populate correctly
   - Test filtering by region
   - Test filtering by conference
   - Test combined filters

4. **Test Latest Race Column**
   - Verify dates display in table
   - Check date formatting
   - Ensure sorting works correctly

5. **Test Athletic.net Links**
   - Update MatchupHistoryModal to use separate meet_id and race_id
   - Verify links navigate to correct meets
   - Test across multiple matchups
   - Validate URL format: `/meet/{meet_id}/results/{race_id}`

### Phase 2: Additional Refinements (Always Do)

Regardless of izzypy_xcri status, implement any new feedback:

1. **UI/UX Improvements**

## Known Issues from Session 019

### ⚠️ Awaiting izzypy_xcri Fixes

1. **Region/Conference Names Not Populating**
   - Status: Backend JOIN implemented, but table structure mismatch
   - Blocker: Team Rankings table requires algorithm_type/scoring_group
   - Solution: Direct field population in Team Knockout table
   - Priority: HIGH - Blocks key filtering functionality

2. **Athletic.net Links Using race_id Twice**
   - Status: Using race_hnd for both meet_id and race_id as workaround
   - Blocker: Database only stores race_hnd
   - Solution: Add separate meet_id field to matchups table
   - Priority: HIGH - May cause 404 errors or wrong meet links

### ✅ Fixed in Session 019 (Verify Still Working)

1. Team links disabled (no 404 errors)
2. Column labels updated correctly
3. Size column removed
4. Ordinal formatting working (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
5. Modal titles updated
6. FAQ anchors working
7. Documentation cross-references accurate
8. Historical snapshot banner displays

## Backend Code Changes to Make

### If Region/Conference Fields Are Now Available

**File**: `api/services/team_knockout_service.py`

```python
# REMOVE JOIN logic (lines 84-123 in get_team_knockout_rankings)
# REPLACE with direct field selection:

query_sql = f"""
    SELECT
        id, team_id, team_name, team_code,
        rank_group_type, rank_group_fk, gender_code,
        regl_group_fk, conf_group_fk,
        regl_group_name,           # NEW: Direct field
        conf_group_name,           # NEW: Direct field
        most_recent_race_date,     # NEW: Direct field
        regl_finish, conf_finish,
        knockout_rank, team_five_rank, elimination_method,
        team_size, athletes_with_xcri, team_five_xcri_pts,
        h2h_wins, h2h_losses, h2h_win_pct,
        checkpoint_date, season_year, calculation_date
    FROM iz_rankings_xcri_team_knockout
    WHERE {where_sql}
    ORDER BY knockout_rank
    LIMIT %s OFFSET %s
"""
```

Do the same for `get_team_knockout_by_id` function.

### If meet_id Field Is Now Available

**File**: `frontend/src/components/MatchupHistoryModal.jsx`

```jsx
// UPDATE Athletic.net link (line ~213):
<a
  href={`https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/meet/${matchup.meet_id}/results/${matchup.race_hnd}?tab=team-scores`}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="meet-link"
  title="View meet results on Athletic.net"
>
  {matchup.meet_name}
</a>
```

**File**: `api/models.py`

```python
# ADD to TeamKnockoutMatchup model (after race_hnd):
meet_id: int = Field(description="AthleticNET meet identifier")
```

**File**: `api/services/team_knockout_service.py`

```python
# UPDATE SELECT statements to include meet_id:
SELECT
    m.matchup_id,
    m.race_hnd,
    m.meet_id,        # ADD THIS
    m.race_date,
    m.meet_name,
    # ... rest of fields
```

## Notes for Claude

**Session 020 Prerequisites**:
- Review session-019-wrap-up.md for context
- Review session-019-izzypy-improvements-needed.md for requirements
- Ask user about izzypy_xcri status before proceeding
- Be prepared to adapt based on what's available

**Session Flow**:
1. Ask user: "Have the izzypy_xcri data structure improvements been implemented?"
2. If YES: Follow Phase 1 (Integration) → Phase 2 (Refinements) → Phase 3 (Testing)
3. If NO: Follow Phase 2 (Refinements only) → Phase 3 (Testing) → Document pending items
4. If PARTIAL: Integrate what's available → Note what's pending → Continue with refinements

**Integration Approach**:
- Start with backend (verify data exists in database)
- Update API models and queries
- Update frontend to use new fields
- Test thoroughly at each step
- Deploy incrementally if possible

**Testing Emphasis**:
- Data accuracy is critical (region names, conference names, dates)
- Link functionality must be validated (no 404s)
- Filters must work correctly (no empty results when data exists)
- Performance must remain acceptable

---

**Ready to begin Session 020**: Wait for user confirmation that izzypy_xcri improvements are available, then proceed with integration and testing.
