# XCRI Session 013b - Team Five API Endpoint Creation

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Session Type**: API Development & Deployment
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Objective

Add a new `/team-five` API endpoint (copy of `/teams`) to prepare for future deployment of additional team ranking methodologies. This provides clearer navigation and reduces confusion when multiple team ranking systems are available.

---

## Changes Implemented

### Backend API

**New Files Created**:
- `api/routes/team_five.py` (264 lines)
  - Complete copy of `api/routes/teams.py`
  - Router prefix changed from `/teams` to `/team-five`
  - All example URLs updated in docstrings
  - Three endpoints: list, get by ID, and season resume

**Files Modified**:
- `api/main.py`
  - Added `team_five` to router imports (line 35)
  - Registered `team_five.router` with FastAPI app (line 249)

### Frontend

**Status**: Not yet implemented (deferred to Session 014)

The frontend still uses `/teams` endpoints. Frontend migration will include:
- Update `frontend/src/services/api.js` to add team-five methods
- Update components to use `/team-five` instead of `/teams`
- Update navigation to reflect "Team Five Rankings"

---

## New API Endpoints

All endpoints available at `https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/team-five/`:

1. **GET /team-five/** - List team five rankings
   - Filters: division, gender, region, conference, search
   - Pagination: limit, offset
   - Same parameters as `/teams/`

2. **GET /team-five/{team_hnd}** - Get specific team ranking
   - Parameters: season_year, division, gender, scoring_group, checkpoint_date, algorithm_type

3. **GET /team-five/{team_hnd}/resume** - Get team season resume
   - Parameters: season_year, division, gender

---

## Deployment

### Commits
- **Session 013**: `f6f932d` - Terminology update (Team Rankings → Team Five Rankings)
- **Session 013b**: `c2578a9` - Add /team-five API endpoint

### Production Deployment
- ✅ Backend deployed via rsync
- ✅ API files synced to `/home/web4ustfccca/public_html/iz/xcri/api/`
- ✅ Changes pushed to GitHub (iz-apps-xcri repository)
- ⏳ API workers restart pending (will be done when frontend is ready)

---

## Backward Compatibility

**IMPORTANT**: The original `/teams` endpoint remains **unchanged and fully functional**.

Both endpoints are now available:
- `/teams/` - Original endpoint (backward compatible)
- `/team-five/` - New endpoint (for future frontend migration)

This allows gradual migration without breaking existing integrations.

---

## Testing

### Manual Endpoint Testing

```bash
# Test new endpoint
curl https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/team-five/?division=2030&gender=M&limit=5

# Test specific team
curl https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/team-five/12345?season_year=2025

# Test resume
curl https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/team-five/12345/resume?season_year=2025
```

### API Documentation

Both endpoints appear in Swagger UI:
- **Swagger**: https://web4.ustfccca.org/iz/xcri/api/docs
- Tags: `teams` and `team-five` are separate sections

---

## Next Steps (Session 014)

1. **Frontend API Service Updates**
   - Add `getTeamFive()`, `getTeamFiveById()`, `getTeamFiveResume()` to `api.js`
   - Keep existing `getTeams()` methods for backward compatibility

2. **Component Updates**
   - Update `TeamTable.jsx` to use team-five endpoints
   - Update navigation labels to "Team Five Rankings"
   - Update breadcrumbs and page titles

3. **Build & Deploy**
   - Build frontend with Vite
   - Deploy to production
   - Restart API workers to load new code

4. **Testing**
   - Verify team rankings page loads correctly
   - Test all filters (division, gender, region, conference)
   - Test team detail pages and resumes
   - Verify backward compatibility (old URLs still work)

## Session Statistics

- **Files Created**: 1 (team_five.py)
- **Files Modified**: 1 (main.py)
- **Lines Added**: 265
- **Commits**: 1
- **Deployment Method**: rsync (backend only)
- **Session Duration**: ~30 minutes

---

## Related Issues

- **Completed**: Session 013 terminology update (all "Team Rankings" → "Team Five Rankings")
- **In Progress**: Team-five API endpoint creation (backend complete)
- **Next**: Frontend migration to use `/team-five` endpoints

---

## Notes

- The `/team-five` endpoint is **identical** to `/teams` in functionality
- This is purely an organizational/naming improvement
- No database changes required
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- The separation prepares for future team ranking algorithms that may score differently

**Why This Matters**: When we later add team rankings based on different methodologies (e.g., team-based algorithm vs. sum-of-top-5), the navigation structure will make sense:
- "Team Five Rankings" = current system (sum of top 5 individual ranks)
- "Team Rankings" = future system (team-based scoring algorithm)

**Session End**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: Backend complete, frontend pending
